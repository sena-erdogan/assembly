# assembly

Three simple assembly programs written to get familiar with registers, basic memory operations, and control flow.

Each example progressively introduces more instructions:
- Basic arithmetic using load, addi, and xor
- Simple control flow using jmp and conditional jumps
- Basic memory access via [R1] notation
